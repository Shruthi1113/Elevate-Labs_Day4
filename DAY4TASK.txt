I analyzed the employee_data_cleaned dataset to gain insights into the organizationâ€™s workforce. I explored employee demographics, departmental distribution, performance ratings, tenure, and supervisory structures. I identified top-performing employees and departments, analyzed trends based on employee status, age, and marital status, and reviewed termination patterns and diversity across departments. To make the analysis more efficient, I created views and indexes for repeated queries. Overall, my work highlights performance, team structures, and workforce trends, providing actionable insights for HR decision-making and strategic planning.
